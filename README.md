# Blender_Script_ListExternalAssets
Python script to generate text summary of external source files used in a Blender file (ChatGPT generated)

1) Copy/Paste into Text Editor inside Blender
2) Run the script using the Play button
3) It will output to a Text file called External_Assets_List which can be found in the Text Editor file list.

Absolute minimal testing at the moment but found it useful and couldn't easily find a similar thing online
